## PhD
 + Studying high-temperature, nonequilibrium flows.
 + Experience with high-perforamnce computing and advanced numerical methods

## Ibis
Performance portable compressible computational fluid dynamics solver I wrote in my spare time to better understand fundamental computational fluid dynamics methods, and learn about GPU computing
[Ibis](https://wattrg.github.io/ibis/ "Ibis home page")

Some features of Ibis:
 + Runs on all GPUs supported by Kokkos
 + Unstructured grids
 + Any explicit Runge-Kutta method
 + Steady-state acceleration using JFNK
 + Shock-fitting (shock on boundary or internal to the domain)
